# Folx-App for iOS
Face Recognition application
## Description

Folx-App for iOS is a sample game that demonstrates how to use iPhone X and ARKit's facial recognition features to quickly identify facial expressions as the user performs them.

<b>To play</b>, first build and run with Xcode on your iPhone X. Then hit Start Game! FaceOff will tell you one expression at a time (for example: "Smile"), and you'll have a limited period to show that expression.

Once you've lost all your lives, you'll be greeted (surprised?) with a looping animation of all the expressions from your session :).

<b>iPhone X</b> is required to build and run this project, as ARKit's ARFaceTrackingConfiguration is only available on iPhone X at this time.
